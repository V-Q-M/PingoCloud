# PingoCloud

This is my own Cloudstorage/ file-sharing system designed for small home servers.
It is optimized for Vimium in browsers by utilizing direct download instead of buttons.

When looking for a fileserver on my homeserver i only found solutions which are bloated with features i don't need.
At the same time file-sharing services like nfs or samba are incredibly cumbersome slow.
That is why I decided to make my own file-sharing system which only supports necessary features and intuitive navigation.
Finding and managing your local shares has never been easier!

# How to use

Every file has a card with a file preview. Below it is a "button" which when clicked (or hint followed with vimium) automatically downloads the file.\\

# Supported features are:

- File downloads
- File uploads

# Upcoming features are:

- File removal
- Folder creation

# Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/vqm/PingoCloud.git
